# Notable Results 
------
The write up for the rest of the project is in the README.docx / README.pdf file

**underneath each image, the final similarity and size thresholds are given. Each image was initially merged with the similarity threshold of 0.1 and size of 1/150 of the total image size**

<img src='./fineTunedResults/colors.tif'>
similarity: 0.1, size: 1/150 I used this image as one way to verify that my method worked. If there were bugs, one way they would have manifest themselves is by improperly merging the distinct colors.
